```html
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
  <!-- Content here -->
</div>
```
This code uses Tailwind CSS to create a gradient background. However, it can cause issues if the `from` and `to` colors are not properly specified or if the gradient direction is not what you expect.
